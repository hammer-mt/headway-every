When I first started out, I wasn't sure if this was the right career for me, but over time I discovered that helping people is truly my calling. My approach combines elements of cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, psychodynamic therapy, narrative therapy, solution-focused brief therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, emotionally focused therapy, and several other modalities that I have studied extensively over the course of my career. I believe that every client deserves a therapist who will listen deeply, respond thoughtfully, and create a space where healing can truly occur. In my free time, I enjoy reading about the latest advances in neuroscience and psychology, attending conferences and workshops to stay current with best practices, and volunteering at local community mental health organizations. I am also a certified yoga instructor and incorporate mindfulness practices into my daily life and clinical work. My office is a warm, welcoming space filled with comfortable furniture, calming artwork, and the gentle sound of a small tabletop fountain that many of my clients find soothing. I look forward to hearing from you and beginning this journey together. Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions about my practice, my approach, or anything else that might help you feel comfortable taking this important first step. Remember: seeking help is not a sign of weakness — it is one of the bravest things a person can do. I truly believe that, and I hope you will too.",
